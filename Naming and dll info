annoyingly but expectedly the way to name and give applications icons is weird.
"
$EXEICON = 'path/to/icon-image'
_TITLE "Title Bar Text"
"
is how you name and icon a application.

some other cool things I'll have to look into is the addition 
and use of dll's in code aka 
1. not everything is in the exe
2. you can make open gl calls 'n shit
3. even more low level stuff. that's technically cross compatible 
if you use the QB64 dll format.
